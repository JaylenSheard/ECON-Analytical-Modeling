# ECON 6485: Analytical Modeling Assignments ✍️

This repository contains a series of assignments completed as part of my Analytical Modeling course for the Fall 2024 semester. Each assignment showcases different analytical modeling techniques and approaches applied to real-world economic and data science problems.

## Course Overview

**Course:** ECON 6485: Analytical Modeling  
**Instructor:** Dr. Adrian Austin 
**Institution:** University of West Georgia 
**Semester:** Fall 2024

The course focuses on various modeling techniques used in economics and data science, including regression analysis, classification, clustering, and more. Students will gain hands-on experience working with real datasets, developing models, and interpreting the results.

## Assignments Overview

Below is a list of assignments completed during the semester. Each assignment folder contains a Jupyter Notebook with the code and analysis, along with any necessary data files and a report summarizing the findings.

### Completed Assignments

1. **Assignment 1: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) with Iris Dataset**
   - **Description:** This assignment involves implementing the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm on the Iris dataset to classify different species of flowers. The notebook includes data preprocessing, model training, cross-validation, and evaluation with a confusion matrix.
   - **Files:** 
     - `KNN_IrisDataset.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook with the full implementation.
     - `KNN_Instructions.pdf`: Instructions for the assignment.

### Upcoming Assignments

The following assignments will be added to this repository as they are completed throughout the semester:

2. **Assignment 2:** Title and details will be added upon completion.
3. **Assignment 3:** Title and details will be added upon completion.
4. **Assignment 4:** Title and details will be added upon completion.
5. **Assignment 5:** Title and details will be added upon completion.
6. **Assignment 6:** Title and details will be added upon completion.
7. **Assignment 7:** Title and details will be added upon completion.

## How to Use This Repository

Each assignment is organized into its own folder, containing all relevant files:
- **Jupyter Notebooks (.ipynb):** Contains the Python code and analysis.
- **Data Files (.csv, .xlsx, etc.):** Datasets used for analysis.
- **Instructions (.pdf or .md):** Guidelines and requirements for each assignment.
- **Reports (.pdf or .md):** Summarized findings and insights from the analysis.
