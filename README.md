# ECON 6485: Analytical Modeling Assignments ✍️

This repository contains a series of assignments completed as part of my Analytical Modeling course for the Fall 2024 semester. Each assignment showcases different analytical modeling techniques and approaches applied to real-world economic and data science problems.

## Course Overview

**Course:** ECON 6485: Analytical Modeling  
**Instructor:** Dr. Adrian Austin 
**Institution:** University of West Georgia 
**Semester:** Fall 2024

The course focuses on various modeling techniques used in economics and data science, including regression analysis, classification, clustering, and more. Students will gain hands-on experience working with real datasets, developing models, and interpreting the results.

## Assignments Overview

Below is a list of assignments completed during the semester. Each assignment folder contains a Jupyter Notebook with the code and analysis, along with any necessary data files and a report summarizing the findings.

### Completed Assignments

1. **Assignment 1: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) with Iris Dataset**
   - **Description:** This assignment involves implementing the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm on the Iris dataset to classify different species of flowers. The notebook includes data preprocessing, model training, cross-validation, and evaluation with a confusion matrix.
   - **Files:** 
     - `KNN_IrisDataset.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook with the full implementation.
     - `KNN_Instructions_Findings.md`: Instructions for the assignment.

2. **Assignment 2: Support Vector Classifier (SVC) with Customer Churn Dataset**
   - **Description:** This project aims to predict customer churn using a Support Vector Classifier (SVC) on a customer churn dataset. The firm’s goal is to identify customers who are likely to churn and offer a retention incentive to maximize earnings. By predicting churn effectively, the firm can minimize revenue losses by providing a discount to at-risk customers and retaining them.
   - **Files:** 
     - `SVM_CustomerChurn.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook with the full implementation.
     - `SVM_Instructions_Findings.md`: Instructions for the assignment.

3. **Assignment 3: Simple and Multiple Linear Regressions with Insurance Dataset**
   - **Description:** This project analyzes insurance premium data to develop predictive models and provide recommendations on pricing strategies. The key factors in this analysis include smoker status, BMI, region, and other demographic variables. The notebook uses various regression techniques to determine how these factors influence insurance premiums.
   - **Files:** 
     - `LRG_InsuranceDataset.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook with the full implementation.
     - `LRG_Instructions_Findings.md`: Instructions for the assignment.

### Upcoming Assignments

The following assignments will be added to this repository as they are completed throughout the semester:

4. **Assignment 4:** Title and details will be added upon completion.
5. **Assignment 5:** Title and details will be added upon completion.
6. **Assignment 6:** Title and details will be added upon completion.
7. **Assignment 7:** Title and details will be added upon completion.

## How to Use This Repository

Each assignment is organized into its own folder, containing all relevant files:
- **Jupyter Notebooks (.ipynb):** Contains the Python code and analysis.
- **Data Files (.csv, .xlsx, etc.):** Datasets used for analysis.
- **Instructions (.pdf or .md):** Guidelines and requirements for each assignment.
- **Reports (.pdf or .md):** Summarized findings and insights from the analysis.
